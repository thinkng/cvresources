## 1. Books

* Handbook of Machine Vision - A. Hornberg (http://as.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-3527405844.html)

   *This is the first book I read about machine vision. It covers almost everything from Machine vision project analysis, Lens & Camera  selection guide, Optics formulars, Illumination, fundamental Image processing algorithms to modern industrial applications. 
   The book cost some money but you can file a pdf version somewhere.*
   
* The Imaging & Vision Handbook by Stemmer Imaging (https://www.stemmer-imaging.co.uk/en/the-imaging-vision-handbook/)

  *Similar to Handbook of Machine Vision but less theoretic stuff and more updated with recent applications. Get it free at Stemmer's website.* 
  
* Algorithms for Image Processing and Computer Vision (2nd Ed.) - J.R. Parker 2011 (http://as.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470643854.html)

  *This is the most useful collection of hand-on tutorials about fundamental CV algorithms. OpenCV and C are deployed for examples.*
  
* Deep learning - Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville - 2016. (http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
  *I had a project dealing with Deep Convolutional Network for object classification so I read some chapters of this book for an understanding. Recommend these chapters: Part I(1,2,3,4,5); Part II (Chapter 6,7,8,9); Part III (14). The book is free!*
